# 1. Evercity Carbon Credits Pallet

This repositary contains source code of blockchain node, which is a main part of Evercity's Carbon Credits project.

# 2. Introduction

Evercity Carbon Credits Pallet provides Substrate-based Sustainable Finance Protocol to issue and monitor carbon credits, as well as to integrate carbon credits with green and sustainability-linked bonds. 
Carbon credits are financial instruments, tradable certificates that represent a right to emit one ton of CO2. Carbon markets can be divided into three main parts: UNFCCC-led international carbon market which is compulsory for countries operating under Kyoto protocol (CDM), national compulsory carbon markets (e.g. in China) and voluntary carbon markets which are led by voluntary standards (VCS, Gold Standard, and others). 

# 3. Overview

Powered by Parity Substrate blockchain engine, Pallet Carbon Credits is an open-source software which allows participants to issue, transfer and monitor carbon credits.

# 4. Evercity carbon credits project main entities

Carbon Credits pallet has several main entities: 

### 4.1 Project 

Entity for carbon credits project documentation signing and annual reports creating 

### 4.2 Annual Report 

Entity for confirming annual volume of carbon credit issuance

### 4.3 Carbon Offset Certificate 

Entity for granting certificates for carbon emissions offsetting using carbon credits

### 4.4 Carbon Credit Passport 

Entity for registering carbon credits as assets  


# 5. Evercity Roles and Carbon Creditis project scenario

### 5.1 Roles

The evercity role model presented in evercity accounts pallet https://github.com/EvercityEcosystem/evercity-accounts

- CC_PROJECT_OWNER: the role which can create carbon projects, annual report and issue caebon credits
- CC_AUDITOR: the role to sign project documentation and annual reports according to carbon credits standard
- CC_STANDARD: the role to sign project documentation and annual reports according to carbon credits standard
- CC_REGISTRY: the role to sign project documentation and annual reports according to carbon credits standard

### 5.2 Basic scenario

Here is the basic scenario on of carbon credits releasing and offetting:

- Project owner creates document and stores its hash into filesign pallet (extrinsic - pallet_evercity_filesign - create_new_file()). 
Any account can access this extrinsic.

- Project owner creates a Project in Carbon Credits pallet, choosing a carbon credits standard(extrinsic - create_project()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step.

- Project owner can change project file id in a Project in Carbon Credits pallet to a new one. Available before signing starts(extrinsic - change_project_file_id()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step. Also it must be the project owner and file owner in blockchain storage.

- Project owner adds signers and their roles to project(extrinsic - assign_project_signer()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step. Also it must be the project owner in blockchain storage.

- Then starts project signing, the sign order depends on carbon credits standard. 
At the end, the project owner is ready for producing annual report for carbon credits production (extrinsic - sign_project()).
The role, which can access this step id defined by carbon credits standard. For example, gold standard  sequence is CC_PROJECT_OWNER -> CC_AUDITOR -> CC_STANDARD -> CC_REGISTRY. 
Also signers must be holed in blockchain storage.

- Project owner creates document and annual report in project with carbon credits asset_id and asset metadata (extrinsic - create_annual_report()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step. Also it must be the project owner in blockchain storage.

- Project owner adds signers and their roles to annual report (extrinsic - assign_last_annual_report_signer()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step. Also it must be the project owner in blockchain storage.

- Then starts report signing, the sign order depends on carbon credits standard (extrinsic - sign_last_annual_report()).
The role, which can access this step id defined by carbon credits standard. For example, gold standard  sequence is CC_PROJECT_OWNER -> CC_AUDITOR -> CC_STANDARD -> CC_REGISTRY. 
Also signers must be holed in blockchain storage.

- At the end, the project owner can release carbon credits (extrinsic - release_carbon_credits()).
Only project owner account with CC_PROJECT_OWNER role mask can run this step. Also it must be the project owner in blockchain storage.

- User can transfer carbon credits (extrinsic - transfer_carbon_credits()).
Any carbon credits holder can access this function.

- User can burn carbon credits (extrinsic - burn_carbon_credits()).
Any carbon credits holder can access this function.


Some other functions:

- Project owner can delete last annual report if it is not full signed(extrinsic - delete_last_annual_report())

- Project owner can remove account from project signers if it didnt sign the document (extrinsic - remove_project_signer())

- Project owner can remove account from last annual report signers if it didnt sign the document (extrinsic - remove_last_annual_report_signer())
